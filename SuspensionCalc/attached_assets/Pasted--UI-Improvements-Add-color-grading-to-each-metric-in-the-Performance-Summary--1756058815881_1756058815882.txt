 **UI Improvements**
   - Add **color grading** to each metric in the Performance Summary:
     - Green → Excellent / Safe values
     - Yellow → Acceptable but needs improvement
     - Red → Dangerous / Out of range
   - Example:
     - Ride Quality Score: >8 = Green, 5–8 = Yellow, <5 = Red
     - Handling Balance: Balanced = Green, Mild Under/Oversteer = Yellow, Severe = Red
     - Roll Compliance: Excellent = Green, Moderate = Yellow, Poor = Red
     - Bump Compliance: Excellent/Good = Green, Fair = Yellow, Poor = Red
   - Each metric should visibly change color to reflect status.

2. **Help / Info Buttons**
   - Add a small **“?” icon** (tooltip or popup) beside each performance parameter.
   - When clicked, it should explain:
     - What the term means
     - Why it is important
     - Recommended safe/ideal ranges for Baja ATV and general ATVs
   - Example:
     - Ride Quality Score → "A measure of comfort and terrain absorption. 8–10 = Excellent, <5 = Harsh ride."
     - Handling Balance → "Indicates steering behavior. Balanced is ideal; too much understeer/oversteer reduces control."
     - Roll Compliance → "How well suspension manages chassis roll. Excellent = stable cornering."
     - Bump Compliance → "Ability to absorb sudden shocks without losing traction. Higher = safer on rough terrain."

3. **Export to Word**
   - Add export option to generate a **Word report (.docx)**.
   - Report formatting must be:
     - Text color = black
     - Font = Arial or Calibri
     - Font size = 11 or 12 pt
     - Professional layout (headings bold, metrics in tables, notes in italics if needed)
   - Include both **raw values** and **color-coded status (Excellent/Good/Poor)** in the document.

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Use **Python (FastAPI or Flask)** to handle:
     - Data processing (calculate whether values fall in Excellent/Good/Poor)
     - Serving help text content dynamically
     - Generating the Word report
   - Frontend communicates with backend to fetch help text and performance grading.

⚡ The main goal:  
- The dashboard should not only **show results** but also **teach the user what each term means and highlight dangerous values clearly**.
- The exported report should look **professional and easy to share**.
